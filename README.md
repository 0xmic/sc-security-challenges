# Calyptus Smart Contract Security Challenge



Time to get your hands dirty!

In this section of the course, you get to use the smart contracts related skills you have acquired so far. This section has 10 challenges, and the difficulty of the challenges increases as you go further.

The game has two characters, Alice and Bob. You help Bob who is trying to give Alice a hard time. Some challenges may time to time introduce other characters as well.

Some challenges require Bob to steal the funds from Alice's smart contracts, some want Bob to halt Alice's smart-contracts using a DOS and some want Bob to blow Alice's mind.

Are you ready to play the game?

## System Requirements

To use this repo you should have the following programmes installed in your machine:

- Node ^18.12.1 [installation guide](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-install-nodejs/)
- Yarn Package Manager [installation guide](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)

## How to play

### Clone this repo, cd into it and install the dependencies by pasting the following code into your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Calyptus-Learn/SC-Security-Challenges.git && cd SC-Security-Challenges && yarn install
```

### Start Solving the challenges

The `contracts` folder consists of the smart-contracts mentioned in each challenge. `test` folder consists of the setup scripts of each challenge. Pass the test to win the challenge.

Some challenges would need you to deploy your own smart-contracts, write those in the `contracts/BobsContracts` folder.

Use ethers.js to code the steps of your hack into the `Exploit` section of the test script. Use Bob's account to perform all the exploits by using [.connect(bob)](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/single-page/#/v5/api/contract/contract/-%23-Contract-connect) notation from ethers.js

The default "Exploit" section of all the test files look like this:

```js
it("Exploit", async function () {
  /** CODE YOUR EXPLOIT HERE  */
});
```

After writing your exploit, run this script from your terminal:

```bash
npx hardhat test <PATH_TO_THE_TEST>
```

## Challenge 1

### No Privacy (Vulnerability: Accessing Private Variables)

---

Alice has deployed a secret Lock on blockchain that opens with a password. Help Bob find out the password and unlock the lock to win this challenge.

**Check out the [No Privacy](contracts/NoPrivacy/AlicesLock.sol) smart-contract and find a way to unlock it.**

**Pass this [Test](test/no-privacy.js) to win the challenge.**

### Solution Notes

In Ethereum, smart contract data is stored in a section of the blockchain called the contract's storage. This storage is divided into slots, with each slot capable of storing a 32 byte word. Smart contract variables are assigned slots in the order they are declared in the contract, starting from 0. This contract storage is publicly accessible to anyone that knows how to read it.

The getStorageAt function provided by ethers.js allows you to read the raw data in a specific storage slot of a given Ethereum address. In your smart contract, the password variable is stored at slot 1 (as the locked boolean variable is at slot 0), so calling getStorageAt(lock.address, 1) retrieves the bytes32 password value from the smart contract's storage.

Therefore, the reason why the ethers.provider.getStorageAt function is used in this scenario to "hack" the contract is because the password variable is not really private. Despite the password being marked as a private variable, it's important to know that 'private' in Solidity does not mean 'hidden'. It only means that it can't be accessed directly by other contracts, but its value is still stored openly on the blockchain.

In the context of the test, the getStorageAt function is used to retrieve the password from the contract's storage and then call the unlock function with that password, which unlocks the lock and allows the test to pass. This highlights an important concept in smart contract development: sensitive data, like passwords or private keys, should never be stored directly on-chain, because they can be easily retrieved using functions like getStorageAt.

## Challenge 2

### Head or Tail (Vulnerablilty: Randomness through global variable)

---

Alice and Bob are flipping a coin to decide who is a better smart contract programer.

Help Bob win the coin flip 5 times in a row to win the challenge.

**Check out the [Head or Tail](contracts/HeadOrTale/HeadOrTail.sol) smart-contract and find a way to hack it.**

**Pass this [Test](test/head-or-tail.js) to win the challenge.**

### Solution Notes

The HeadOrTail contract is a simple coin flip game where the result of the flip is pseudo-randomly generated by taking the hash of the previous block (blockhash(block.number - 1)) and dividing it by a certain FACTOR. If the result is 1, it means "heads" (represented as true) and if it's not 1, it means "tails" (represented as false). If the player's guess is correct, they win and the 'wins' counter increments by 1.

The vulnerability here lies in the way the contract generates randomness. In Ethereum, all data is transparent, including the block hash. It means that one can predict the result of the coin flip by calculating it the same way the contract does.

Bob exploits this vulnerability by creating another contract (BobsGuess) that calculates the result of the coin flip before actually flipping the coin in the HeadOrTail contract. Specifically, BobsGuess takes the address of the HeadOrTail contract as a parameter, calculates the expected result of the coin flip (by using the same logic as the flip function), and then calls the flip function with the expected result.

In the test, an instance of BobsGuess is created and the cheat function is called 5 times in a row, each time predicting the result of the coin flip and then flipping the coin with the predicted result, which results in Bob winning the coin flip 5 times in a row.

This challenge demonstrates the risks of generating randomness on-chain and relying on block variables for randomness. Even though block variables like block.timestamp or block.number seem unpredictable, they can be manipulated or predicted by miners or, in some cases, by other smart contracts. Therefore, it's generally considered unsafe to use block variables to generate random numbers in Ethereum smart contracts, especially when the result of the randomness could lead to a significant gain or loss for any party involved.

## Challenge 3

### Mount Calyptus (Vulnerability: Denial of Service due to push pattern)

---

Everyone wants to be at the top of Mount Calyptus, but there's space for only one. As they say, everything can be bought with money, so can be the spot at the summit. Whoever sends the Mount Calyptus Smart Contract an amount of ether that is larger than the current bribe replaces the previous climber. On such an event, the replaced climber gets paid the new bribe, making a bit of ether in the process!

Alice wants to be at the top at all cost! Alice reclaims the top spot as soon as anyone claims it sending equal bribe.

Help Bob stop Alice from reclaiming the atTheTop position.

**Check out the [Calyptus Hill](contracts/CalyptusHill/CalyptusHill.sol) smart-contract and find a way to hack it.**

**Pass this [Test](test/calyptus-hill.js) to win the challenge.**

## Challenge 4

### Do Not Trust (Vulnerability: Insecure External Call)

---

Alice has deployed a `Do Trust Lender` pool that offers free flash-loans to everyone!

Awesome right?

The pool has 1 million Calyptus Tokens (CPT) in balance. Complete the challenge by making Bob steal all the CPTs from the pool and send them into the his account.

**Check out the [Do Trust Lender Pool](contracts/DoNotTrust/DoTrustLender.sol) smart-contract and find a way to hack it.**

**Pass this [Test](test/do-not-trust.js) to win the challenge.**

---

## Challenge 5

### Re-enter (Vulnerability: Reentrancy)

---

Alice has deployed a simple lending pool that allows its users to deposit ETH, and withdraw it at any point in time.

This simple lending pool already has 1000 ETH in balance, and is offering free flash loans using the deposited ETH.

Help Bob steal all the ETH from Alice's lending pool.

**Check out the [ReenterPool](contracts/Reenter/Reenter.sol) smart-contract and find a way to hack it.**

**Pass this [Test](test/reenter.js) to win the challenge.**
